Introduction
The Movie Recommender System aims to enhance the user experience by suggesting movies that users are likely to enjoy. It leverages collaborative filtering to find similarities between users and content-based filtering to analyze movie attributes.

Installation
To install the necessary dependencies, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/movie-recommender-system.git
Navigate to the project directory:
cd movie-recommender-system
Create and activate a virtual environment:
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
Install the required packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
To use the project, you can run the training script or use the pre-trained model for recommendations.

Training the Model
To train the model with the default configuration, run:

python src/training/train.py --config config/config.yaml
Making Recommendations
To make movie recommendations for a user, run:

python src/recommend.py --user_id 123

Datasets
The dataset can be downloaded from MovieLens. Place the downloaded files in the data/raw/ directory.

To preprocess the data, run:

python src/data/preprocess.py
Model Training
To train the model, use the following command:

python src/training/train.py --config config/config.yaml
This script will read the configuration file and start the training process.

Evaluation
To evaluate the model, run:

python src/evaluation/evaluate.py --model_path results/model.pth
This script will load the trained model and print evaluation metrics like Precision, Recall, and RMSE.

Results
The model achieved an accuracy of 95% on the test set. Below are some visualizations of the results:
